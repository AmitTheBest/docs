Quick Start
====
The quickest way to install Agile Toolkit is by opening http://agiletoolkit.org/ and clicking on the download link. You will download a ZIP bundle containing the following:

 * Framework inside atk/ folder
 * Some demo applications
 * Few useful add-ons in folder atk4-addons
 * Sample application in other folders 

Once downloaded and unpacked into your web-root, open the new folder inside your browser and you will see an Agile Toolkit installer, which will help you to:

 * Register your Agile Toolkit with appropriate license (free or paid)
 * Download some recommended add-ons
 * Set-up database if you wish to use some examples
 * Save configuration into `config.php` file.

Installer application can be helpful to upgrade Agile Toolkit in the future, install additional add-ons or change your license settings. To invoke installer at a later time, add `/installer/` to the web URL where you have installed Agile Toolkit.

### Securing your install
Your Agile Toolkit installation contains `public` folder. If you are concerned about exposing parts of your application on web-root you should change your web-root to point inside this `public` folder.

### Advanced Installation
You can install Agile Toolkit through a number of alternative ways:

 * Git clone
 * Packagist.org
 * PHAR
