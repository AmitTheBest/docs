### How Forms in Agile Toolkit are different with Forms in other Frameworks?

Forms in Agile Toolkit are fully self-sufficient. Once you initialize the form, it will stand on the page on it's own, it will handle submission properly, it will automatically validate itself, encode received output and integrate with JavaScript. Other frameworks tend to focus primarily on form display
Forms are also designed for flexibility and with minimalism in mind. As developer you might be putting dozen of forms on your page and you would want them to work quickly and without conflicts.

Finally â€” Fields in Agile Toolkit are designed to cover basic data types. Additional input elements, such as sliders, can be created through progressive enhancement, where a numeric field is transformed into slider through JavaScript.
