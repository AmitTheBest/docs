Agile Toolkit is a PHP framework for development of Web Application. It is inspired by Mobile and Desktop frameworks, but the concept is used for building Native HTML applications. Agile Toolkit has a strong philosophy and is driven by the key 5 principles: Simple, Advanced, Composite, Inherited and Agile.

In terms of features - Using Agile Toolkit will offer you a consistent HTML/CSS-based interface out of the box, objects for UI widgets, Data Modeling tools, support for relational and NoSQL data storages with minimum amount of coding.

Agile Toolkit is entirely driven by PHP language (except for templates) - no need to learn anything new. It has a very low entry barrier for beginners and is a great way to learn most popular web language - PHP.

If you use Agile Toolkit for your project, it will also enforce consistent and readable code, making support and long-term projects highly cost-efficient. When you introduce a new experienced developer to your existing project, he will be able to track down and understand structure of your project almost instantly and perform critical changes without danger of breaking the project.

Agile Toolkit comes integrated with www.agiletoolkit.org to further help developers with basic tasks such as getting help, finding and installing add-ons, sharing code and publishing your project to your own free web hosting.

Agile Toolkit framework is dual licensed - AGPL license permits use in personal and open-source projects. Additionally you receive free hosting for your project with no time limitation.

For developers looking to develop closed-source projects and deploy those to their own private servers a paid subscription will be required for the duration of development comparable. This is comparable to the private repository service offered by github.com.

## Comparing Agile Toolkit

### to Xcode / Cocoa for iOS from Apple

Agile Toolkit offers PHP developers a similar experience to Xcode by Apple for developing of iOS application.

* Both are free to download and use
* Both require to subscribe for commercial application deployment
* Both offer sophisticated framework (Cocoa and Agile Toolkit PHP)
* Both focus on providing you, developer, with great tools to help you develop
* Both offer you full-stack solution
* Both allow you to use most of the advanced environment technologies with simple interface.

### to other Open-Source web frameworks

Competing PHP framework offer you partial solution, require much higher knowledge, require you to write more code, offer no user interface, does not encourage you to write Open-Source projects, does not offer free app hosting, offer no community portal yet very expressive commercial support and are inherently designed to be "complex" or "slow" so that the company behind the framework could sell more commercial support / training or enterprise server solutions.
