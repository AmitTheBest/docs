## The Application Core

The Agile Toolkit Core sits in the `/atk4` directory and handles the plumbing of your application. The key features are:

* [Configuration](../application/configuration.md): configuring the application and Controllers
* [Class Loading](../application/class-loading.md): automatic lazy loading of classes as they are required
* [Request Routing](../application/routing.md): loading the correct Page class to handle the request
* [Asset Management](/TODO): serving CSS, JavaScript, image and other media files
* [Event Hooks](../applicaiton/hooks.md): a callback mechanism for running code at specific points in the execution process
* [Authentication & Authorization](/TODO): controlling access to the application and its features
* [Error Handling](../application/exception-handling.md): help with handling and logging various types of error
* [Testing](../application/testing.md): a simple but rather useful built-in unit testing framework.
