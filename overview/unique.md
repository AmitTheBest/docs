You might be asking me - why not use one of the other frameworks and build user interface for it? Allow me to explain.

### 1. Agile Toolkit is more mature then the most PHP frameworks

The foundation for Agile Toolkit (previously "amodules") finds it's roots in 1999, when it was a collection of tools, like many those "mee too" frameworks you probably come across once in a while or you might even have your own. Since 1999 a small commercial team was continuously building web apps on top of the framework gradually perfecting it.

It was a 3rd major rewrite and a jump to PHP5.3 when Agile Toolkit finally was ready to be shared with the rest of the world.

Traditionally Agile Toolkit was not following the general trends but would focus on cultivating it's own principles and approaches into a super-efficient toolkit.

### 2. Agile Toolkit is on a unique mission

While other PHP frameworks have been copying each-other and trying hard to advance it's code-base, Agile Toolkit takes a very revolutionary approach to web development process.

1. Everything working solution out-of-the-box
2. Insanely flexible through use of true Object-Oriented Programming
3. Write efficient and clean PHP code that just works.
4. It is just so beautiful - both the front and back.
5. No over-bloating with features. Focus on what's important.

### 3. Full-stack PHP Framework

Controlling the foundation lets us build high-level extensions with confidence. Going from the very bottom to the top, we can add more and more layers:

1. Data layer - Talk with your Data Source efficiently.
2. Page Routing - Awesome MVP implementation.
3. Speedy Template engine for HTML.
4. Great Application classes for Frontend, Admin or Installer.
6. Great CSS Themes and Layouts
7. Sandbox development environment - the missing PHP-IDE
8. AgileToolkit.org cloud services - making your life easier.
5. Visual Add-ons with amazing functionality.
6. Support for OpenSource and Commercial.
