Agile Toolkit has undergone a 3 (THREE) major refactoring stages. Each stage was heavily used in hundreds of agile commercial projects with all sorts of requirements. The 4.0 of Agile Toolkit have been released in 2008 and have significantly matured without loosing key benefits.

If you develop your web software (or part of it) using Agile Toolkit - you'll have the most efficient development cycle you have ever experienced. The time you save on project support, component development and bug fixes significantly outweigh your commercial licensing and training costs.
